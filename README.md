# EC2-Coastal-Land-Conversion
EXCHANGE Campaign 2 Coastal Land Conversion Project 

Synthesis of EC1 baseline data, and existing and EC2 data to produce new knowledge on coastal land conversion and test the hypothesis that rates of upland conversion (and threshold elevations) will be fastest in locations where terrestrial soil samples have high water content, small grain size, high C, and low N availability, and in locations where adjacent water samples have high salinities.
